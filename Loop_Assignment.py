# # For Loop ia used for iterating over a sequence (That is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a srting).
# # Example
# fruits = ['apple','banana','cherry']
# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)
# # Exercise
# for x in 'banana':
#     print(x)
#     # The "BREAK" Statement
# fruits = ['apple','banana','cherry']
# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)
#     if x == 'banana':
#         break
#     print(x)
#     #Ex
# fruits = ['apple','banana','cherry']
# for x in fruits:
#     if x == 'banana':
#         break
#     print(x)
#     # The "CONTINUE" Statement
#     fruits=['apple','banana','cherry']
#     for x in fruits:
#         if x == 'banana':
#             continue
#         print(x)
# # The "RANGE()" Function
# for x in range(6):
#     print(x)
# for x in range(2,6):
#     print(x)
# for x in range(2,30,3):
#     print(x)
# # the Else in for Loop
# for x in range(6):
#     print(x)
# else:
#     print("finally finished !")
# for x in range(6):
#     if x == 3: break
#     print(x)
# else:
#     print("Finally finished !")
# for x in range(10):
#     if x != 7: break
#     print(x)
# else:
#     print("Finally finished !")
# # The NESTED Loop
# adj = ["red","big", "tasty",]
# fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
# for x in adj:
#     for y in fruits:
#      print(x ,y)
# # The PASS Statement
# for x in [0, 1,2]:
#     pass
# # The "WHILE" Loop
# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1
#     i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
# Example
# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
#     if (i == 3):
#         break 
#     i+=1
# i = 2
# print(i)
for i in [1,2,3]:
    pass
i = 0
while i < 6:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
# The Else Statement
i = 1 
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print(" i is no longer less than 6 ")
